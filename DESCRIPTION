Description: Implements marginal effects estimation using probability machines.
             Based on the paper "Risk estimation using probability machines" by
             Dasgupta et. al. Provides (will provide - 02/02/2016) methods for
             several models. Provides (will provide - 02/02/2016)
             similarly-formatted results for marginal effects from parametric
             models as well.
