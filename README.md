Implements marginal effects estimation using probability machines.
Based on the paper "Risk estimation using probability machines" by
Dasgupta et. al. Provides (will provide - 02/02/2016) methods for
several models. Provides (will provide - 02/02/2016)
similarly-formatted results for marginal effects from parametric
models as well.
